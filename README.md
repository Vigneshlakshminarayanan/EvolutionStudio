# EvolutionStudio
A Monkey gradually transforms to a well mannered human. At one stage, we all Evolve. So as is programming. Welcome to my "EvolutionStudio". 
## Synopsis
How about when you are lost in middle of the town & you are in need of essential verticals around you. 
How convenient would it be, when you get all the information you request for at a click of a button. 
EvolutionStudio has thought about bringing you the ultimate solution for your problem through this LocalSearch App.
