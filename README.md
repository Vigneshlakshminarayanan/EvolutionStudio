# EvolutionStudio
A Monkey gradually transforms to a well mannered human. At one stage, we all Evolve. So as is programming. Welcome to my "EvolutionStudio". 
## Synopsis
How about when you are lost in middle of the town & you are in need of essential verticals around you. 
How convenient would it be, when you get all the information you request for at a click of a button. 
EvolutionStudio has thought about bringing you the ultimate solution for your problem through this LocalSearch App.
## Code Example
A list of essential verticals around you.

**let titleCollection:NSArray = ["Movies","Education","Hospital","ATM","Petrol Bunk","Restaurants","Bar","Coffee","Dinner"]**

Make a local search to find a list of verticals matching your category

**localSearchRequest.naturalLanguageQuery = sharedIns.cateogorySelected as String**

Displays a list of all verticals on **MKMapView**
